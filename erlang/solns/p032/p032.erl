%We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

%The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

%Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

%HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

%TOMMY NOTE
%This problem took me a LONG TIME. But my ending solution is short and nearly instant. 
%
%The trick I was missing for awhile was that the product can only have 4 digits in it. 3 digits and
%the multiplicands and product will have less than 9 digits, and 5 digits (or more) and the
%multiplicands and product will have more than 9 digits. 
%
%I didn't realize this until I knew I had to constrain the space of the problem because there were
%something like 100 billion possible multiplicands to try. 
%
%Once I realized that, it was easy.
