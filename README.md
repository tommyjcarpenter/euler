# Euler
I have the ambitios goal of completing project Euler. I also want to learn Erlang. So, I am trying to get two birds stoned at once by completing project Euler in Erlang.

# Early Erlang not so great
When I started this project, these were the first lines of Erlang that I have ever written. Thus, the early commits in this codebase (early commits, not early problem numbers, as I did not solve the problems in order) are probably really bad. But, if you want to see how my Erlang is evolving, look at those compared to whatever my most recent commits are. Hopefully there is a progression. I am doing some projects in Erlang outside of this now.

# A little Python..
When I run into a problem that is annoying to do in Erlang, for example lots of text processing, I switch to python. I just can't justify doing a problem in Erlang that can be so much more easily done in python `line.split(" ")...`. Moreover, a few problems were too complex for my level of Erlang at the time I did them. So, here and there are problems written in Python.

# NEW: April 2019: Go
I am starting to learn Go.. might do a couple Euler problems in it to get going!
