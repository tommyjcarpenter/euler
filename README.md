# euler
I have the ambitios goal of completing project Euler. I also want to learn Erlang. So, I am trying to get two birds stoned at once by completing project Euler in Erlang. 

# not great Erlang
When I started this project, I knew 0 Erlang. These were the first lines of Erlang that I have ever written. Thus, the early commits in this codebase (NOTE, early commits, not early problem numbers, as I did not solve the problems in order) are probably really bad. But, if you want to see how my Erlang is evolving, look at those compared to whatever my most recent commits are. Hopefully there is a progression. I am doing some projects in Erlang outside of this now, so there may be large gaps in code style here.
